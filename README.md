# Service-time-prediction-using-tractor-service-data
## Hackathon: “DATATHON 1.0” project | Conducted by GUVI - an IIT-Madras incubated company

•	Create a predictive model to estimate the number of days to service the customer tractor and predict the solution from the step 1 and step 2 observations from customer
•	_**Tools: Python, Pandas, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Scikit-learn, Seaborn**_
•	We cleaned and encoded a real-world dataset of the tractor service using NLP, feature extraction, and then fitted a random forest and K-means ML model. Our model predicts the number of days it takes to complete a tractor service with an R2 value greater than 95 (app.) and clustering records by stage wise
